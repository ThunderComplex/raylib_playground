# Raylib testing

(might be trying to make a full game?)

## Dependencies

BYO Raylib
MSVC with RGFW is a **MUST** (ok technically the backend doesn't matter but GLFW is really slow on startup)
Compile for x64 and chose RelWithDebInfo

Edit build.ps1 to your needs or install MSVC in the same location as I do

Technically works with GCC too but it's funnier this way.
