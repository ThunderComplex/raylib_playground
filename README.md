# Raylib testing

(might be trying to make a full game?)

## Dependencies

BYO Raylib  
MSVC with RGFW is a **MUST** (ok technically the backend doesn't matter but GLFW is really slow on startup)
Compile for x64 and chose RelWithDebInfo / Release.DLL  

Use the raylib included VS2022 project to build
