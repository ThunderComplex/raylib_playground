# Raylib testing

(might be trying to make a full game?)

## Dependencies

BYO Raylib  
MSVC with RGFW is a **MUST** (ok technically the backend doesn't matter but GLFW is really slow on startup)
Compile for x64 and chose RelWithDebInfo

## Usage

Run the build.ps1 script either without arguments or with one argument determining the source file to be built (without the .c extension).  

Edit build.ps1 to your needs or install MSVC in the same location as I do  

Technically works with GCC too but it's funnier this way.
